This application was made for internal use at all Khazanah Nasional Berhad offices. It was developed during my coop (internship) at Khazanah National Americas, in San Francisco in Fall 2015.

The application links to the user's Instagram account, and pulls the media posted and liked by the user and displays a slideshow of the fetched media.
